Use:

necessary dependencies: "Instaloader==2.7.1"


Essentially, only one dependency is required. Python must be installed for the operating system. The account to be monitored must 
be open. You must also be logged in to the account you will be monitoring. 
Additionally, the sender's email address must contain the app password for the Gmail account. 
That is, the app password, not the Gmail account password.

Note: The Gmail account password can be entered as follows: manage your Google account/app password/[any name].

Good luck Team
